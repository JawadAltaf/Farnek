												<h3>Basics</h3>
											</div>
											<div class="wt-description">
												<ul class="mb-3">	
													<li>Sellers create Services on Farnek.uk to allow Buyers to purchase their services.</li>
													<li>Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their Services.</li>
													<li>Each order you sell and successfully complete accredits your account with net revenue of 90% of the purchase amount.</li>
													<li>Farnek accredits Sellers once an order is completed. See our “Orders/Income” section below for a definition of a completed order.</li>
                                                    <li>If an order is cancelled (for any reason), the funds paid will be returned to the Buyer’s Farnek Balance.</li>
                                                    <li>Revenues are only made available for withdrawal from the Revenue page following a safety clearance period of 48 hours after the Service is marked as complete.</li>
                                                    <li>Sellers may not promote their Services or any Farnek content via the Google Ads platform.</li>

                                                    <li>The Seller’s rating is calculated based on the order reviews posted by Buyers. High ratings allow sellers to obtain advanced seller levels (see Levels below). In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the Seller’s account.</li>
                                                    <li>For security concerns, Farnek may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by Buyers, or associating multiple Farnek accounts to a single withdrawal provider.</li>
                                                    <li>Sellers are responsible for paying any direct or indirect taxes apply to them. Sellers represent and warrant that they comply, and will comply at all times, with their obligations under income tax provisions in their jurisdiction. The Service price shown on the Service page is inclusive of all such taxes and charges that may apply to the Sellers.

Buyer’s payment obligation to Seller will be satisfied upon receipt of payment by Farnek.uk (or its Payment Services Provider, as applicable), and Farnek.uk (via its Payment Services Provider, as applicable) is responsible for remitting the funds to the Seller in the manner described in these Terms of Service. In the event that Farnek.uk (via Payment Services Provider) does not remit any such amounts to Seller, the Seller will have recourse only against Farnek.uk and not the Buyer directly. Seller agrees that Farnek may describe or otherwise reflect the terms contained herein in any terms of service, receipts, disclosures, or notices including, but not limited to, receipts provided to Buyers that Farnek may deem necessary or prudent.</li>
                                                    <li>Farnek.uk partners with Payment Services Providers for purposes of collecting Service-related payments from Buyers, transferring such payments from Buyers to Sellers, and holding funds in connection with Sales Balances.
